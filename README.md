# Numerical Project ODE: Modelling Populations using the Lotka-Volterra equations

The goal of this project was to model populations of tomatoes and aphids using differential equations. In the end, ladybugs were added to see how they affect the numbers of the other two when eating the aphids.
The project was part of the course "Ordinary Differential Equations" at Stockholm University.

One of the first exercises was to plot different step sizes when only having aphids as a species. The provided .py file has the option of doing this with one, two and three species. To use this functionality, one can adjust the parameter ‘step‘.
